# Data Engineering Code Interview

## üëã Hi there

Welcome to the Data Engineering code interview! This small data challenge is designed to test out your skills in python, sql, git, and geospatial data processing. The challenge will go from easy to difficult, there's no preassure to finish all the tasks, so try your best and get as far as you can!

To start this challenge, create a new **private** repo under your github username. We would like you to include all the code, notes, visualizations, and data inside of the repo. You will have **48 hours** to complete this data challenge.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: **the repo has to be <ins>private</ins>, otherwise you will be automatically <ins>disqualified</ins>**. Also we will check your commit timestamp to only account for the first 48 hours of coding activities.

## Introduction

We love the NYC 311 service and the open data products that come with it. In this challenge, you will use **[311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)** on NYC Open Data, write an ETL pipeline and produce some data insight.

### Task 1: Download data

Write a python script/notebook to download all service requests openned last week (7 days) and store the data in a csv named `raw.csv` in a folder called `data`

### Task 2: Data Aggregation

Create a time series table based on the `data/raw.csv` file we created from **Task 1** that has the following fields

- `created_date_hour`: the timestap of request creation by date and hour
- `complaint_type`: the type of the complaint
- `count`: the count of service requests by `complaint_type` by `created_date_hour`

Store this table in a csv under the `data` folder with a csv file name of your choice.

### Task 3: Data Visualization

Create a multi-line plot to show the total service request counts by `created_date_hour` for each `complaint_type`. Make sure you store the image of the plot in the `data` folder as a `.png` file.  

### Task 4: Spatial Data Processing

At Data Engineering, we enhance the dataset with useful geospatial attributes, such as adding point location, adding administrative boundaries. To help us better understand the data from **Task 1**, we would like you to join the initial raw data to the **[2020 NTA (Neighborhood Tabulation Area) boundaries](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page)** and create a choropleth map of 7 day total count by NTA of a specific `complaint_type` of your choice.

Depends on how you generate the map, you can store the map as a `.png` or `.html` under the `data` folder.

### Task 5: SQL

We ‚ù§Ô∏è SQL! At Data Engineering, we deal with databases a lot and we write a lot of fast and simple ETL pipelines using SQL. In this task, you will:

- load the `data/raw.csv` into a database of your choice, name the table `sample_311`, make sure this process is captured in a script.
- perform the same aggregation in **Task 2** in SQL and store the results in a table (same name as the corresponding csv file)

> Note: Depends on your preference, you can use [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) or [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), please document your decisions and rationale.

### Task 6: Spatial SQL

A lot of popular databases have geospatial extensions, which makes spatial data processing in SQL super easy to use. In this task you will:

- load the NTA data to the database as a spatial table
- do a spatial join in SQL between `sample_311` and the NTA table and add a `nta` column to `sample_311`
- perform the same aggregation in **Task 4** and store the result in a table.
- **Bonus**: export the table with NTA geometry and complaint count into a shapefile under the `data` folder.  

> Note: At this point you might notice that spatial software is not as straight forward as a simple `pip install`, If you are stuck with database installation or pacakge installation, please consider adopting **[docker](https://www.docker.com/)**.
